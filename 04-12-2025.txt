Java Introduction
-----------------
- Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language developed by James Gosling
  at Sun Microsystems
- Sun Microsystems is acquired by Oracle Corp in 2010 year
Object Oriented Concepts java 25 java 8(2014),Java 11,  Java 17 (Migration) 
------------------------
- Object
- Class
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
Object
------
An object is a real time entity which has identity, state and behavior
Refer diagram Object.png
Class
-----
A class is a collection of data members and methods
Ex:
	class Person
	{
	   //Data members
	   int age;
	   String name;
	   float height;
           //Methods
 	   void walk(){...}
           void eat(){...}
	}
{} => block/scope
age = 25;//error
The members (data members/methods) of the class are accessed using objects with dot(.) operator
Creating objects
----------------
syntax (Rules of a language)
------
ClassName objName = new ClassName();
Ex:
	Person p = new Person();//p is an object of class Person
p.age = 25;
	p.name = "John";
	p.height = 5.4;
	p.walk();
	p.eat();


Virtual Machine:- A Machine Which simulates the physical machine and perform the tasks like physical machine. 
Types of Virtual Machines:-
1. Hardware type Virtual machines/system based (single machines multiple Users) (Kernal based Virtual Based ) , VMWare 
	2. Application based or Software based Virtual Machines (Java Virtual Machine) 
	These Virtual Machines are runtime Engine to run Java based Applications
	
	JDK :- Java Development KIT
	JRE:- Part of JDK  () 
	JVM :- it is a part of JRE it is a runtime Engine to run java classes. To load and run java application line by line
	Jvm is divided into 3 components 
	Class loader subsystem (Responsible to load java class files ):- To load .class files into Memory Area (Loading, Linking and Initialization) 
	Execution Engine is responsbile to execute the program Line by line 
	Memory Areas:- Method Area(.class file), Heap Area(Where objects will be stored), Stack Area, PC Registers(Next execution instruction Address), Native Method Stacks
	
	Execution Engine -> Java Native Interface(JNI), Native Method Libraries
